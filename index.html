<h2 style="color: #00B200">Introduction</h2>
Stellation is a multi-player, networked game played via a web browser. It's
very loosely based on Planetarion, but fixes a number of things that I feel
are lacking. (But don't let me put you off Planetarion; it's a great game ---
but I think that it could be so much better.)

<p>One of Stellation's main differences is that it features real geography; a
galaxy of about a hundred (currently) stars on a 2D grid. You can occupy as
many of the stars as you wish, and have the military might to keep from the
other players, of course.</p>

<p>Currently it is in alpha testing. You're welcome to create a player and
play with it. However, large portions of the game aren't finished. In
particular, game interactions with other players don't work terribly well:
there is no combat system yet, for example, and trying to look at another
player's units tend to fail.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I welcome testers. The more people who play it, the sooner
the bugs will be found. The more people who tell me how great they think the
game is, the more encouraged I will get and the quicker development will
proceed... <br>

    <p>If you want to play, follow this link. You'll need a web browser that
    supports tables and Basic HTTP authentication (if you don't know what this
    means, don't worry; I have yet to find a browser that doesn't).</p>

  <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/stellation">SourceForge's
    Stellation development page.</a>
    <p>Stellation is open source. Where better to host it than SourceForge? If
    you want to see how it works, want to set up your own Stellation server,
    or feel like fixing something you think is broken, this is the place to
    go. You can also find the (currently unused) Stellation discussion forums
    and mailing lists here.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.moo.mud.org">LambdaMOO</a>
    <p>Stellation uses the LambdaMOO VM as its core run-time system. This
    gives us lots of nice features like persistant storage, an object-oriented
    garbage-collected byte-code interpreted language, incremental development
    so I can modify the system without having to rebuild the database, dead
    easy network interfaces, easy remote administration, and lots of other
    funky features.</p>
    <p>Note that Stellation's database has been written from scratch; it
    doesn't share any features with LambdaCore. Stellation is <i>not</i> a
    MOO.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #00B200">How to play Stellation</span></h2>
Stellation has two types of units; mobile units and stationary units. Mobile
units are comprised of things like cargo ships, jumpships, warships, and so
on. Stationary units are things like factories, refineries, and buoys. Mobile
units are collected into groups called <b>fleets</b>; and it will be these,
usually, that you will direct. Stationary units can be either built on-site or
else built elsewhere and then towed by a tug.

<p>Speed of light constraints mean, of course, that you can only communicate
with one of your units if there's an FTL transceiver nearby. These
transceivers are housed in special units called <b>jumpships</b>. These ships
will be crucial to your campaign. Not only do they provide communication to
your units (you can't even <i>see</i> a unit unless it's in the same solar
system as one of your jumpships) but they also provide the only means of
transport: a fleet containing a jumpship can travel from one star to another,
at the rate of one parsec per hour, and the appropriate quantity of fuel.</p>

<p>Which brings us to a major point. Consumables.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of consumable in Stellation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Metal
    <p>Metal is refined from metallic asteroids by automated metal refineries.
    Most units don't consume metal as a matter of course, but you will need
    it, and plenty of it, when building new units.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Antimatter
    <p>Antimatter is produced from sunlight by antimatter distilleries. The
    quantity of antimatter produced, of course, depends on how bright the star
    is. Antimatter is used as an energy source; units will consume a steady
    stream of the stuff. It's also used as fuel by jumpships. The amount of
    fuel needed for a particular star jump depends on the geometry of the
    transit bubble required: in layman's terms, the mass of the fleet being
    transported and the distance required. Oh, did I mention that a jumpship's
    FTL transceiver doesn't work inside a transit bubble?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Organics
    <p>Organic material is required to maintain the crews of your units, and
    more importantly, their bioelectric control systems tend to die without
    it. It is made by hydroponics plants, which colonise carbonaceous
    asteroids with greenhouses. You need both the asteroids and sunlight to
    produce organics. Units require a small amount to run, and a slightly
    larger amount to build.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
If one of your units needs some consumables but can't get them, it will die
and go out of commission. You'll lose it. You really don't want this to
happen, particularly if the unit in question is a jumpship; the fleet will
just drop off your scanners. Later, someone may find a few bits of useless
debris floating in empty space...

<p>There are strict rules as to where units get their consumables from. Mobile
units will always try to find a cargoship in the same fleet. If one of the
cargoships can provide the material required, so be it. Otherwise, the
material will be looked for in the free stocks in orbit around the current
star.</p>

<p>Be careful. Unless you keep these rules in mind, you can be in trouble. For
example: you've just jumped into a new star system. You create a new fleet,
and transfer some of your units to it. The units promptly die. Why? Because
the star has no resources of consumables, and the units in the new fleet can't
access the cargoship that's in the old fleet, and will starve. Heaven help you
if one of the units you transferred <i>was</i> your cargo ship... all the
units in the old fleet will die, including your jumpship, and you'll lose
track of both of them. The cargo ship will survive, though. </p>

<h2><span style="color: #00B200">Recommended starting strategy</span></h2>
When you first start the game, you're given a few units to get started with.
It can be fairly annoying doing the wrong thing and wiping out your entire
fleet, so here are some tips to get you started.
<ol>
  <li>Unload your cargo ship. Do this by entering negative numbers into the
    <i>Load</i> boxes. The resources will be placed in orbit around the
  star.</li>
  <li>Unload your tugs. You'll get a basic factory and a complete set of
    refineries.</li>
  <li>Deploy them all. The metal refinery and hydroponics plant will eat an
    asteroid each and start production.</li>
  <li>Start building something with your basic factory.</li>
</ol>
From here you're on your own. There are various things you can do; for
example, you could build yourself another jumpship so you can send your
original fleet off exploring and still keep track of what your home system's
doing. You may decide to build a set of refineries and another factory first,
so that if you come across a nice-looking star system you can colonise it. You
may decide, instead, to sit tight and build lots of defensive units. You may
build lots of factories so you can produce lots of units at once. Hey, this is
the thing that makes the game fun.
