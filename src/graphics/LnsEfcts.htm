The Lens Effects Include File actually consists of two files, <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I>
and <I>Lens.inc</I>, which should both be copied to one of the directories
(folders) in your POV-Ray library path.  Normally this is the <I>INCLUDE</I>
sub-directory of the directory where you installed POV-Ray, so if you
installed POV-Ray in <I>C:\POVRAY</I> you should copy the files to
<I>C:\POVRAY\INCLUDE</I>.  On a Windows 95 system, this is probably something like:

<P><I>C:\Program Files\POV-Ray for Windows\Include</I>

<P>On UNIX and similar systems, where filenames are case-sensitive, you may
have to rename the include files so the filenames are all capitals.
This will enable you to render the sample files without modification.

<A NAME="Quick Start"></A><TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>QUICK START</B></I></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
The Lens Effects Include File allows you to add a whole range of different
lens effects (including lens flares, glows, sparkles, etc.) to any POV-Ray
scene.  To add a simple lens flare to a scene, add the following lines
to your POV file:

<P><CODE>#declare camera_location = &lt 6, 20, -30&gt ;
<BR>#declare camera_look_at = &lt 0, 3, 3&gt ;
<BR>#declare effect_location = &lt -3, 4, 3&gt ;
<BR>#include "Lens.inc"</CODE>

<P>changing the values shown above to match the camera in your scene (the
<A HREF="#effect_location">effect_location</A> specifies the location of the light_source or object
that you want to add a lens effect to).  When you render the scene, you
should now see the default "Rainbow" lens effect added to it.  In
addition to this one lens effect, you can choose from 18 other predefined
lens effects, or create your own completely custom effects.  You can also
use a range of options to fine-tune the lens effect to suit your scene.
To use any of these options just add the following line to your scene file,
<B>before</B> including <I>Lens.inc</I>:

<P><CODE>#declare </CODE> <I>[variable-name]</I><CODE> = </CODE><I>[value]</I>

<P>substituting the desired variable name and value where appropriate.
Note that <I>Lens.inc</I> (or <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I>) should <B>never</B> be included at the start
of a scene (like <I>colors.inc</I> or <I>textures.inc</I>).  They should only be
included after declaring the desired lens effect and camera options.  To
create more than one lens effect in a scene, you should declare the first
set of options and include <I>Lens.inc</I>.  Then declare the next set of
options and include <I>Lens.inc</I> again, but note that you don't have to
redeclare the camera options, or any other options that remain the same for
both lens effects, eg. if you were creating two "Sparkle" effects in
different locations, you would only have to redeclare the <A HREF="#effect_location">effect_location</A>
the second time, rather than all the other options.

<P>Note that the Lens Effects Include File supports both British and
American English, eg: <I>effect_colour</I> and <I>effect_color</I> are interchangeable,
as are <I>spots_to_centre</I> and <I>spots_to_center</I>, etc.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>CAMERA OPTIONS</B></I></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
To add a lens effect to your scene, you must properly declare the camera
options (which should always match those found in the camera {} statement).
Depending on the camera options you have used, you will have to declare
some or all of the following options:

<P><CODE>camera_location, camera_look_at, camera_sky
   camera_direction, camera_angle</CODE>

<P>Correctly declaring these options will ensure that the lens effects are
created properly.  Note that if you transform (ie. rotate, translate) the
camera, you should do the same to the variables, eg. if you had:

<P><CODE>camera {location -z * 10 look_at y * 2
<BR>rotate x * 45
<BR>translate &lt -5, 10, 2&gt
<BR>rotate y * clock * 360}</CODE>

<P>you should perform the same operations on the <I>camera_location</I> and
<I>camera_look_at</I> options, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare camera_location = -z * 10;
<BR>#declare camera_location = vrotate(camera_location, x * 45);
<BR>#declare camera_location = camera_location + &lt -5, 10, 2&gt ;
<BR>#declare camera_location = vrotate(camera_location, y * clock * 360);

<P>#declare camera_look_at = -z * 10;
<BR>#declare camera_look_at = vrotate(camera_look_at, x * 45);
<BR>#declare camera_look_at = camera_look_at + &lt -5, 10, 2&gt ;
<BR>#declare camera_look_at = vrotate(camera_look_at, y * clock * 360);</CODE>

<P>Note that the Lens Effects Include File will always create the camera
for you, using the values you specify for the above options (so there
is actually no need to have a separate camera {} statement in the POV
file).

<A NAME="Options"></A><TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7><TR><TD BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>LENS EFFECTS OPTIONS</B></I></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
This section explains the different effects that can be created using
<I>Lens.inc</I>, and the options you can use to fine-tune a lens effect.

<P><A NAME="effect_type"></A>
<B>effect_type</B>
<HR>
Use this option to choose a different lens effect from the default
"Rainbow" lens flare.  To use a different effect type, just add the line
(<B>before</B> including <I>Lens.inc</I>):

<P><CODE>#declare effect_type = "Sun"</CODE>

<P>substituting the name of the desired effect.  The available effect types
are <I>Camera, Camera2, Candle, Diamond, Headlight, Headlight2, Rainbow,
Rainbow2, SoftGlow, Sparkle, Sparkle2, Spotlight, Spotlight2, Star, Star2,
Sun, Sun2, Sun3</I>, and <I>Undersea</I>.  You can see a sample of all of these
effect types by rendering the <I>LE_SAMP*.POV</I> scenes.  In addition, there is
the <A HREF="#Random">Random</A> lens effect.  Note that this option is
case-insensitive, ie. <CODE>effect_type = "HEADLIGHT"</CODE> is the same as
<CODE>effect_type = "headlight"</CODE>.

<P><A NAME="effect_location"></A>
<B>effect_location</B>
<HR>
This option specifies the location of the object that you want to add
the lens effect to.  With light_sources this should be the same as the
location vector in the light_source {} statement, and with other objects
it is usually the centre of the object.  Note that if you use rotate and
translate to move the light_source or object, you should follow the
<A HREF="#Camera Options">directions above</A> to do the same to the <I>effect_location</I> option.

<P><A NAME="effect_colour"></A>
<B>effect_colour</B>
<HR>
Use this option to change the overall colour of the lens effect.  You can
use predefined colours (eg. <CODE>#declare effect_colour = Red</CODE>) or colour vectors
(eg. <CODE>#declare effect_colour = &lt 1.3, .3, .2&gt</CODE>).  When using vectors, note that
the components are relative to each other, so you can use decimal
percentages, integer percentages, or other values, eg. &lt 1, .2, .2&gt is the
same as &lt 100, 20, 20&gt or &lt 5, 1, 1&gt.  Also, this option will affect different
lens effects in different ways, eg. using:

<P><CODE>#declare effect_colour = &lt 1, .5, .5&gt</CODE>

<P>will make a yellowish effect like "Sun3" become orange, while a bluish
effect like "Spotlight2" will become purple.

<P><A NAME="source_colour"></A>
<B>source_colour</B>
<HR>
Normally all the lens effects have a white centre.  You can use this option
to change this to a different colour.  Unlike the <A HREF="#effect_colour">effect_colour</A> option,
the vector components of this option are not relative.  This means that
you can use larger numbers to create a brighter centre, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare source_colour = &lt 2, 2, 1&gt</CODE>

<P>will give a much brighter yellow centre than:

<P><CODE>#declare source_colour = &lt 1, 1, .2&gt</CODE>

<P><A NAME="effect_scale"></A>
<B>effect_scale</B>
<HR>
Use this option to change the size of the lens effect.  You can use a
single number, or a vector, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare effect_scale = 2</CODE>

<P>will make the lens effect twice as large, while:

<P><CODE>#declare effect_scale = &lt .3, .1, 1&gt</CODE>

<P>will make the lens effect 30% as wide and 10% as high (the z-component is
not used).

<P><A NAME="effect_rotate"></A>
<B>effect_rotate</B>
<HR>
Use this option to rotate the lens effect around its own centre (the
effect location will not change).  You can also use the <A HREF="#effect_spin">effect_spin</A> option
to change the rotation during an animation.

<P><A NAME="effect_brightness"></A>
<B>effect_brightness</B>
<HR>
All the various lens effects are generally designed to look best on a dark
background.  Therefore, if your scene does not have a dark background the
lens effect may not be visible enough.  You can use this option to
increase (or decrease) the brightness of the lens effect for a particular
scene.  Good values range from 1 (the default) to 2 (for an effect twice as
bright).  Any number can be used, and you can even use negative numbers to
create a black hole type of effect.

<P><A NAME="effect_intensity"></A>
<B>effect_intensity</B>
<HR>
Use this option to make the lens effect more (or less) visible.  Setting
this option to 0 will make the lens effect disappear, while numbers less
than 1 will make the lens effect fainter than usual.  Numbers larger than
one will make the lens effect less transparent, and therefore more visible
(without increasing the brightness of the effect).  You can also use
negative numbers, which have the strange effect of making the lens effect
invisible except when there are other objects behind it.

<P><A NAME="effect_always_on_top"></A>
<B>effect_always_on_top</B>
<HR>
Normally the lens effects always appear on top of all the other objects in
the scene.  You can set this option to false to make the lens effect
disappear behind other objects that are in front of it.  This makes the
lens effect an actual object in the scene, and so it will be reflected by
other mirrored objects, and it will be affected by fogs, media,
refraction, etc.  This can also be used to make the lens effect compatible
with certain camera options (eg. focal blurring, orthographic projection),
which may not otherwise work properly with the Lens Effects Include
File.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>LENS EFFECTS ANIMATION OPTIONS</B></I></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
This section lists the various options that can be used to animate the
lens effects in a scene.

<P><A NAME="effect_shrink"></A>
<B>effect_shrink</B>
<HR>
Use this option to make the lens effect decrease in size as the
effect_location moves further from the camera.  Note that you will
generally have to increase the <A HREF="#effect_scale">effect_scale</A> to quite a large number,
depending on the size of the object you are adding the glow to (eg. if you
want to add a glow to a sphere with a radius of 1, you will probably need
to use an <I>effect_scale</I> of 6 or larger).

<P><A NAME="effect_falloff"></A>
<B>effect_falloff</B>
<HR>
Normally the lens effect is brightest when it is located at the centre of
the screen/image.  As the lens effect moves away from the image centre it
begins to fade, until at some point it disappears altogether.  You can use
this option to set the angle at which the lens effect disappears.  It
is similar to the falloff option of a spotlight, eg. if you imagine the
camera as a cone (with its tip at the <I>camera_location</I>, and its base centred
on the <I>camera_look_at</I> point), this option specifies the angle made by
the centre line of the cone and its sides.  The lens effect disappears
when it moves beyond the sides of the cone.  The default value is 60
degrees, but you can use any number between 0 and 90 degrees.

<P><A NAME="effect_falloff_power"></A>
<B>effect_falloff_power</B>
<HR>
Use this option to change the rate at which the lens effect fades as it
moves away from the centre of the image.  The default is 1, which gives
a linear falloff (eg. when the lens effect is halfway between the image
centre and the angle specified by the effect_falloff option, it is created
at half the normal intensity).  Numbers larger than 1 will the make the
falloff rate slower (ie. the effect only begins to fade closer to the
effect_falloff angle), while numbers less than 1 will make the lens
effect fade quicker as it moves away from the image centre.

<P><A NAME="effect_spin"></A>
<B>effect_spin</B>
<HR>
Use this option to automatically change the <A HREF="#effect_rotate">effect_rotate</A> value as the
POV-Ray clock changes.  The number used specifies the number of rotations
per clock unit, eg. <CODE>#declare effect_spin = 3</CODE> will make the lens effect
spin 3 times between clock = 0 and clock = 1.  Positive numbers specify
an anti-clockwise rotation, while negative numbers specify a clockwise
rotation.

<P><A NAME="effect_jitter"></A>
<B>effect_jitter</B>
<HR>
Use this option to randomly move the lens effect by a certain amount for
each frame of the animation.  Setting this option to 0 will make the lens
effect stationary; setting this option to 1 will move the lens effect by
up to 10% of the image width in any direction.  You can use any number
to increase or decrease the amount of jittering, and you can use a vector
to move the effect more in one direction than another (the x-component
controls the horizontal movement, the y-component controls the vertical
movement).

<P><A NAME="effect_flicker"></A>
<B>effect_flicker</B>
<HR>
Use this option to randomly alter the size, brightness, and intensity of
the lens effect for each frame of the animation.  Setting this option to
0 specifies a constant lens effect, while setting this option to 1 will
flicker the lens effect by up to 100% of it's normal size, brightness,
and intensity.  You can use numbers smaller than 1 to reduce the flicker,
or larger numbers to increase the amount of flickering.

<P><A NAME="rays_flicker"></A>
<B>rays_flicker</B>
<HR>
Most lens effects include some sort of rays, which start at the centre of
the lens effect and move outwards.  Setting this option to true will
randomly change the direction and size of these rays for each frame of
the animation, adding to the flickering effect of certain lens effects
(this is especially useful with the Candle and Sun effect types).

<P><A NAME="spots_contract_to_centre"></A>
<B>spots_contract_to_centre</B>
<HR>
This option controls the behaviour of the lens effect spots as they approach (and reach) the centre of the image.
If this option is false (the default), the spots expand and contract as they near the centre of the image, while always keeping around the same number of spots visible.
This usually looks best for still scenes, but when rendered in an animation the lens effect may not behave quite the way you want, especially if it reaches the direct centre of the image (where the angle of the spots will probably be incorrect).
You can set this option to true to make the spots fully contract when they reach the centre of the image (so all spots are located at the same place), avoiding any problems in animations.

<P><A NAME="effect_anim_seed"></A>
<B>effect_anim_seed</B>
<HR>
The <A HREF="#effect_jitter">effect_jitter</A> and <A HREF="#effect_flicker">effect_flicker</A> options can be used to add a certain
amount of randomness to the lens effect.  You can use this option to change
the random number seed used to calculate this randomness (the default is 0).

</TD></TR></TABLE>
In addition to using the many predefined lens effects included with
<I>Lens.inc</I> (as well as using all of the above options to fine-tune these
predefined effects) it is possible to use the Lens Effects Include File
to create your own custom lens effects.  This section details the various
methods you can use to do this.


<P><HR><A NAME="Files"></A>
<B>UNDERSTANDING THE LENS EFFECTS INCLUDE FILE</B>
<HR>
Before starting to create a custom lens effect, you should understand (at
least partly) how the Lens Effects Include File works.  The Lens Effects
Include File actually consists of two files, <I>Lens.inc</I> and <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I>;
<I>LnsEfcts.inc</I> contains the POV code to actually create the lens effects,
while <I>Lens.inc</I> simply declares the necessary options needed to create the
various predefined lens effects.  <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I> is based on a component
system; each lens effect is made up of a number of different features.
<P>These features are:

<UL>the glow - a circle or ring of colour that surrounds the <A HREF="#effect_location">effect_location</A>
<BR>the rays - thin lines that extend from the centre of the glow
<BR>the streaks - thicker lines that pass through the centre of the glow
<BR>the spots - circles or other shapes that extend in a line either side of the centre of the glow
</UL>

<P><I>LnsEfcts.inc</I> includes 8 different glow types, 8 different ray types,
8 different streak types, and 8 different spot types.  This gives a total
of more than <I>5800 different combinations</I> when using at least 1 of each type.
In addition, each component includes a separate set of options that can
be used to alter the characteristics of that individual component (the
various options in the previous section alter every component that makes
up a particular lens effect).  Finally, you can create custom effect files
that use any of POV-Ray's extensive texturing features, to create completely
original lens effects that can be used on their own or combined with any of
the existing lens effects components.


<P><HR><A NAME="Component Options"></A>
<B>LENS EFFECTS COMPONENT OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
This section details the various component options that can be used when
creating a custom lens effect.  To create a custom effect, you simply
declare all the following options that you want to use, and then include
<I>LnsEfcts.inc</I>, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare glow_type = 3;
<BR>#declare rays_type = 2;
<BR>#declare rays_intensity = 2;
<BR>#declare streak_type = 3;
<BR>#declare streak_seed = 1232;
<BR>#include "LnsEfcts.inc"</CODE>

<P>Any options you don't declare will be assigned default values.

<P><HR><A NAME="Glow Options"></A>
<B>GLOW OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
<B>glow_type:</B> a number between 1 and 8 that specifies which glow type to use
  (render the <I>Glows.pov</I> scene to see all the different glow types).  Using 0
  or another number outside of the 1 to 8 range will create a lens effect
  without a glow

<P><B>glow_colour</B>: changes the colour of the glow.  See the explanation of
  <A HREF="#source_colour">source_colour</A> to understand how this option works.

<P><B>glow_scale</B>: changes the size of the glow, relative to <A HREF="#effect_scale">effect_scale</A>

<P><B>glow_rotate</B>: rotates the glow, relative to <A HREF="#effect_rotate">effect_rotate</A>

<P><B>glow_intensity</B>: changes the intensity of the glow, relative to <A HREF="#effect_intensity">effect_intensity</A>

<P><HR><A NAME="Ray Options"></A>
<B>RAY OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
<B>rays_type</B>: a number between 1 and 8 that specifies which rays type to use
  (render the <I>Rays.pov</I> scene to see all the different ray types).  Using 0
  or another number outside of the 1 to 8 range will create a lens effect
  without any rays

<P><B>rays_colour</B>: changes the colour of the rays.  See the explanation of
  <A HREF="#source_colour">source_colour</A> to understand how this option works.

<P><HR><A NAME="Random"></A>
<B>USING THE RANDOM EFFECT TYPE</B>
<HR>
To get an indication of how the various lens effects component options
work you can use the "Random" effect type, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare effect_seed = 12398;
<BR>#declare effect_type = "Random"
<BR>#include "Lens.inc"</CODE>

<P>The Lens Effects Include File will assign random values to the various
component options listed in the previous section, depending on the random
seed specified by the <I>effect_seed</I> option.  Each different number you use
will create a new and different lens effect (but using the same number again
will allow you to reproduce a particular effect).  You can use any number
allowed by POV-Ray, which means that you can create literally millions
of random lens effects without even having to use any of the component
options.  For more information, see the <I>Rand.ini</I> file (which will allow
you to automatically render as many different lens effects as you want).


<P><HR><A NAME="Modify Options"></A>
<B>MODIFYING A PREDEFINED LENS EFFECT</B>
<HR>
Sometimes you may find that you want to use a predefined lens effect, but
wish to alter only certain features of that effect type.  Also, you may
discover a particular Random effect that you like, but want to know the
options that were used to create that effect.  There are two ways of
doing this:

<P><A NAME="options_only"></A>
<B>options_only</B>
<HR>
Setting this option to true <B>before</B> including <I>Lens.inc</I> will not actually
create any lens effect - it will simply set the necessary options for that
effect.  You can then change any of the desired component options, and
include <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I> to create the altered lens effect.  For example, you
may want to use the "Spotlight" effect_type, but use 6 streaks instead of
4, and add some spots:

<P><CODE>#declare effect_type = "Spotlight"
<BR>#declare options_only = true; #include "Lens.inc"

<P>#declare streak_type = 6;
<BR>#declare spots_type = 7;
<BR>#include "LnsEfcts.inc"</CODE>

<P>Or, you may have found a random effect type you like, but want to change
the effect_colour and glow features, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare effect_type = "Random" #declare effect_seed = -8732;
<BR>#declare options_only = true; #include "Lens.inc"

<P>#declare effect_colour = &lt 10, 5, 2&gt ;
<BR>#declare glow_type = 6; #declare glow_scale = &lt 1.5, 1, 1&gt ;
<BR>#include "LnsEfcts.inc"</CODE>

<P>The <I>options_only</I> variable can also be useful when you want to create
multiple copies of the same effect type; that way you only include <I>Lens.inc</I>
once at the beginning of the file, and then declare <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I> each time
you want to create a lens effect (this is faster than including <I>Lens.inc</I>
multiple times), eg:

<P><CODE>#declare effect_type = "Sparkle"
<BR>#declare options_only = true; #include "Lens.inc"

<P>#declare effect_location = &lt -5, 10, -2&gt ; #include "LnsEfcts.inc"
<BR>#declare effect_location = &lt 15, 1, -5&gt ; #include "LnsEfcts.inc"
<BR>#declare effect_location = &lt 0, -10, 3&gt ; #include "LnsEfcts.inc"</CODE>

<P><A NAME="debug_options"></A>
<B>debug_options</B>
<HR>
Setting this option to true will cause the Lens Effects Include File to
print a copy of all the lens effects component options to POV-Ray's
debug stream.  You can then use the +GD command-line switch, or the
Debug_File INI file setting, to direct the debug stream to a file.  This
file can then be altered as desired, and included directly into your
scene before including <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I>.  This is especially useful when
you want to know the exact options used to create a particular Random
effect (see the <I>Rand.pov</I> and <I>Rand.ini</I> files for an example of how this
option can be used).


<P><HR><A NAME="Custom Effect Files"></A>
<B>USING CUSTOM EFFECT FILES</B>
<HR>
If you find that none of the existing lens effects components (or their
options) are able to give you the exact effect you want, you may wish to
consider creating a custom effect file.  This will let you use any and all
of POV-Ray's texturing commands/patterns to create all sorts of different
effects.  The three custom effect files included with the Lens Effects
Include File (<I>Fireball.lfx, Spiral.lfx</I>, and <I>Custom.lfx</I>) show just a few
of the possibilities.  Using a custom effect file is as simple as declaring
the <I>custom_effect_file</I> option with the name of the file you want to use, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare custom_effect_file = "Fireball.lfx"</CODE>

<P>You can then use this file alone, or combine it with other existing lens
effects components, before including <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I> (see the <I>CustLFX.pov</I> file
for some examples of this).  You can also use multiple custom effect files
by including <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I> multiple times, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare custom_effect_file = "MyEffect1.lfx"
<BR>#include "LnsEfcts.inc"

<P>#declare custom_effect_file = "MyEffect2.lfx"
<BR>#include "LnsEfcts.inc"</CODE>

<P>For instructions on how to actually create your own custom effect file
see the <I>Custom.lfx</I> file (which you can copy and alter to create your own
files).

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>TROUBLESHOOTING</B></I></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
This section contains some common problems you might encounter while using
the Lens Effects Include File, and instructions on how to fix these
problems.

<P><HR><A NAME="Troubleshooting Options"></A>
<B>TROUBLESHOOTING OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
The Lens Effects Include File uses layers of semi-transparent discs to
create the various features of the lens effects.  If <A HREF="#effect_always_on_top">effect_always_on_top</A>
is true, these discs are scaled very small and moved very close to the
camera.  If you are using larger numbers (ie. in the millions or larger)
to position the camera and/or effect_location, the default numbers used
when positioning the layers of discs may not work.  Some symptoms of this
include invisible lens effects, and opaque lens effects.  If you encounter
these problems, try using the following options.

<P><A NAME="lens_scale"></A>
<B>lens_scale</B>
<HR>
Use this to increase the size of the imaginary lens used when creating the
lens effects.  If this number is too small relative to the <I>camera_location</I>
the lens effects will become completely invisible.  Try increasing this to
100, or further if this does not solve the problem.

<P><A NAME="layer_separation"></A>
<B>layer_separation</B>
<HR>
Use this option to increase the distance between each layer of discs used
to create the lens effects.  If this number is too small relative to the
<I>camera_location</I> the lens effect may become opaque, or you may get a strange
speckled effect.  Try increasing this number to 10, or further if this does
not solve the problem.

<P><HR><A NAME="Troubleshooting FAQ"></A>
<B>TROUBLESHOOTING FAQ</B>
<HR>

<P><B>Q) I added a lens effect to my scene but I can't see it?</B>
<BR>A: There are various reasons why the lens effect may not be visible.  First
   check that you have properly declared the camera options and
   <A HREF="#effect_location">effect_location</A> according to the instructions above (especially if
   you have transformed the camera or <I>effect_location</I>).  The effect may
   be invisible because it is outside of the camera's view, or because it is
   beyond the effect_falloff distance.  Check for any lens effects warnings
   and make sure the <I>effect_location</I> is in view of the camera.  Try increasing
   the <A HREF="#effect_scale">effect_scale</A> and <A HREF="#effect_intensity">effect_intensity</A> to see if this makes the lens effect
   visible.  Try increasing the <A HREF="#lens_scale">lens_scale</A> and/or <A HREF="#layer_separation">layer_separation</A> options.
   Finally, make sure you have included <I>Lens.inc</I> or <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I> <B>after</B>
   declaring all the correct options (any options declared after including
   the files will have no effect).

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I added a lens effect to my scene, and now I see black areas in the lens
   effect and/or on mirrors and glass in my scene?</B>
<BR>A: You need to increase the max_trace_level, using the following line:

<P><CODE>global_settings {max_trace_level 30}</CODE>

<P>Add this line <B>after</B> including <I>Lens.inc</I> or <I>LnsEfcts.inc</I>, and increase
   the number until the black areas disappear.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I changed my camera {} statement, but the camera didn't move?</B>
<BR>A: You must also make sure that you change the camera options, as described
   above.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) Some parts of the lens effects overlap others, and I can't see through
   them?</B>
<BR>A: Try increasing the <A HREF="#lens_scale">lens_scale</A> and <A HREF="#layer_separation">layer_separation</A> options, as described
   above.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I am using focal blurring, and I can't see the lens effect?</B>
<BR>A: If you wish to use focal blurring you should set <A HREF="#effect_always_on_top">effect_always_on_top</A>
   to false, and make sure that the <A HREF="#effect_location">effect_location</A> is close to the
   focal_point vector.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I am using a different camera projection, and the lens effect doesn't
   look right?</B>
<BR>A: Try setting <A HREF="#effect_always_on_top">effect_always_on_top</A> to false and see if this fixes the
   problem.  Also, you can use the <A HREF="#Spot Options">spots_spacing</A> option to make the spots
   spread across the entire image if you are using a wide camera angle.
