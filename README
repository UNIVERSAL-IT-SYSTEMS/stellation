Introduction 
------------

gdrender is a simple CGI front end around the libgd library. It is used by
Stellation to generate maps and things, but gdrender isn't part of Stellation
proper.

How to use it:

* Please gdrender in a cgi-bin directory somewhere.
* Look up http://hostname.domain/cgi-bin/gdrender?commandstring
* gdrender will return an image/gif or a text/plain, depending whether the 
  image could be generated correctly.

Command string syntax
---------------------

Command strings are formed from a list of words seperated by full stops.
Terminate the string with a double dot. The beginning of the string must start
with:

	width.<w>.height.<h>.

...where <w> and <h> are the width and the height of the image, respectively. After that, you can use any command:

	colour.<r>.<g>.<b>.
		Set the current colour. (You can spell it `color', if you
		like.)
	
	line.<x1>.<y1>.<x2>.<y2>.
		Draw a line from <x1>,<y1> to <x2>,<y2> in the current colour.

	dash.<x1>.<y1>.<x2>.<y2>.
		Draw a dashed line from <x1>,<y1> to <x2>,<y2> in the current
		colour.

	box.<x1>.<y1>.<x2>.<y2>.
		Draw an empty box, etc.
	
	fbox.<x1>.<y1>.<x2>.<y2>.
		Draw a filled box, etc.
	
	arc.<cx>.<cy>.<w>.<h>.<s>.<e>.
		Draw an arc. <cx>,<cy> is the center, <w>,<h> is the size of
		the bounding box, and <s> and <e> are the start and end
		positions of the arc (in degrees).
	
	font.<name>.
		Set the text font. <name> can be t, s, l, g, or mb (tiny,
		small, large, giant, medium-bold).
	
	text.<x>.<y>.<string>.
		Draw some text. <x>,<y> is the top-left corner of the text box.
		<string> is the text to be printed. Note that + is replaced
		with a space character. There is no provision (yet) for
		printing any characters you can't normally put in URLs.
	
	textup.<x>.<y>.<string>.
		Ditto, but draws the text vertically.
